# CSS Basics

This site was created while using TeamTreehouse's CSS tutorial. It was an 8 hour course that I used as a refresher. It covered mostly css and gave tips on creating a mobile responsive website. It's almost a carbon copy of the teamtreehouse example. I modified the images and changed the location to Miami. It also has small style modifications that i made to fit my preferences. This is just a learning tool.
